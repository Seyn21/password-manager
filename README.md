
# Password Manager Web Application

A web-based password manager built with Flask, SQLAlchemy, and Flask-Login for secure storage and management of user passwords. This application allows users to securely store, manage, and retrieve passwords for various websites.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Users can register, log in, and manage their account securely using password hashing.
- **Password Storage:** Users can securely store passwords for different websites, with encryption.
- **Responsive UI:** A simple user interface built with HTML for managing passwords.
- **Flask-Login Integration:** User sessions for login/logout functionality.
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy:** Database management for storing user data and passwords.
- **Flask-Migrate Integration:** Handles database schema migrations.

## Technologies Used

- **Python 3.x**
- **Flask:** Web framework for building the application
- **Flask-SQLAlchemy:** ORM for database integration
- **Flask-Login:** User session management
- **Werkzeug:** For securely hashing passwords
- **Flask-Migrate:** Database migration handling
- **SQLite:** Database used for development (can be replaced with other databases like PostgreSQL)

## Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project locally:

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/password-manager.git
cd password-manager
```

### 2. Set up a virtual environment

For Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate
```

For macOS/Linux:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install the required dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 4. Set up the database

The app uses SQLite as the default database. Run the following to set up the database:

```bash
python
>>> from app import db
>>> db.create_all()
```

Alternatively, if you're using Flask-Migrate, run:

```bash
flask db init
flask db migrate
flask db upgrade
```

### 5. Run the application

After the setup is complete, you can start the Flask application:

```bash
python app.py
```

Visit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser to access the application.

## Usage

### User Authentication

1. **Register an Account:** Go to `/register` and create a new account by providing a username, email, and password.
2. **Login:** After registering, log in using your credentials at `/login`.
3. **Dashboard:** After logging in, you will be redirected to the dashboard where you can add, view, and manage your stored passwords.
4. **Logout:** You can log out by visiting `/logout`.

### Password Management

- **Add Passwords:** In the dashboard, you can add new passwords for different websites.
- **View Passwords:** All stored passwords will be shown in the dashboard.
- **Edit/Update:** Update passwords as needed.
- **Delete:** Remove passwords that are no longer needed.
